We want a JavaScript port of the Java library in repo "dualsalt".

Notes, requirements:

* The Java library is used as a reference.

* This library's functionality should be tested against dualsalt.
  Automatic tests.
  
* This library should follow structure and naming of the reference as
  close as possible.
  
* Same functionality as the reference should be achieved.

* This project uses the MIT License. Any code incorporated from other projects must
  be compatible with this choice of license.
